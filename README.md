Roots.io Sage theme

I've just about managed to cover everything.

Working in a new framework made the timeframe a little challenging, I'm not sure I have followed best practices with Roots/Sage but I made my decisions to work within the time constraints.

I'm not entirely happy with my date display function but I only just finished it in time. I've noticed that it would not work if there is no end date, as there is on 1 of the events in the Figma.
